# BachelorThesis_NodeJS
This repository contains the backend/frontend NodeJS solution from a Bachelor Thesis.
It is created using JavaScript and is based on communication between Google Firebase and a NodeJS backend.

NodeJS establishes a web hosting system and a WebSocket connection for real-time updates to a set of web pages. NodeJS Interacts with Google Firebase in real-time fetching data, which is relayed from a sensor system (Texas Instruments + ESP32 setup). It automatically updates the latest values with the HTTP GET method using callbacks. 
NodeJS Hosts on port 4000 if no environmental value is created and supports the inclusion of files to be served (such as HTML, CSS, JS, etc.)


Requirements:
<lo> 
  <li> NodeJS </li>
  <li> Google Firebase </li>
  <li> Varios NodeJS Modules (see includsion in code) </li>
</lo>
